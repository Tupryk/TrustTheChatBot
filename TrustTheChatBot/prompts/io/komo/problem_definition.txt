## Optimization Process:
1. **User provides a scene and a goal description**.
2. **You generate a JSON response** with:
   - Thoughts explaining the chosen constraints.
   - Python code to update the KOMO optimization.
3. **User evaluates performance** by returning a fitness score.
4. **Your goal** is to **maximize performance** by refining constraints.

## Start
Now please start with writing the optimization problem.
Don't import anything and don't initialize the scene, assume that this has already been set up.
You should solve the following task:
