Given the robotic primitive functions and the scene image, write a python function to solve the problem that will be defined later on.
The scenes image horizontal axes is parallel to the robots x axis. The vertical image axis is parallel to the y axis. The up direction is in z. Think about which x, y and z values to use.
THE POSITION OF AN OBJECT IS WITH RESPECT TO CENTER OF IT'S MESH.
You can only pick on eobject at a time.
Don't forget to pick before you place! Reason about your answer before writing the code. Be careful to follow the correct usage of the functions as descried earlier.
It should solve the following problem:
